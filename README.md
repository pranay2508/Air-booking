Once validated, the user's account is created, and they are redirected to the login page.

5. Booking Page:
On the booking page, users review their selected accommodation, chosen dates, and associated costs.
Additional options, such as room preferences or meal plans, may be presented for customization.
The system calculates the total cost, considering the selected options, and provides a summary.
Users confirm the booking, and the system processes the transaction securely.
